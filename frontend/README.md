---

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
Bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.  

The build is minified and filenames include content hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed.

For more info, see [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

---

### `npm run eject`

**Warning:** This is a one-way operation. Once ejected, you can’t go back.  

Ejecting removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files and dependencies into your project, giving you full control over them.  
Unless you need to customize the build process, you generally don’t need to eject.
